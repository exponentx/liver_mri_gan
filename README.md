# Liver MRI GAN: Application of Conditional Diffusion Models for Semantic 3D Medical Image Synthesis to Abdominal Liver MR Images


[[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18453.pdf)]

This repository is a fork of the official implementation and pretrained model weights for the paper titled "Conditional Diffusion Models for Semantic 3D Medical Image Synthesis." Diffusion models are utilized to generate realistic and high-quality 3D medical images while preserving semantic information. If you use this code, kindly cite the original paper.
